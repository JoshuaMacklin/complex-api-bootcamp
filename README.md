# ðŸ“Š Project: Cat Facts using 2 API's

I returned data from one api to grab a random cat fact of over 500 selections. I then used this same data to make a request to another api to display the data in the Cat version of Pig-latin, Cat-Latin! I then call on a 3rd service to bring you a random picture of a cat from a large community driven database.
